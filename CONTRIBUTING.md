# Guidelines

- every issue worked on with the label "feature" is developed on a seperate branch, commonly know as "feature branch"
- feature branches must be merged into main or release after finishing the feature via pull request
- feature changes will be continued on the already existing feature branch, thus the branch must be updated to main
- issues shall have a tasklist and a precise description what will be changed and why, this must be done with issues labeled as features
- rather mark one issue dependet than put multiple topics or changes into one

## Notes

- guidelines are subject to change due it's work in progress state
